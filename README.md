Simple Platformer [![travis](https://travis-ci.org/LB--/simple-platformer.png?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.org/LB--/simple-platformer) [![gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/LB--/simple-platformer?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)
=================

Just a simple C++14 3D platformer in the public domain, using [Magnum](https://github.com/mosra/magnum).

## Building

Building is done via the CMake superproject in the root directory.
It automatically downloads and builds Corrade and Magnum for you.
If you already have those, just build from the `src` directory instead.

Note: you need to have SDL2 already installed.
